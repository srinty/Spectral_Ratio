# Spectral_Ratio
Here I am performing spectral ratio with two different types of volcanic events, 
Volcano Tectonic and Long Period. I am defining a function for calculating Power Spectral Density. 
We can also use the available function of PSD by scipy or mlab. 
Then performing the ratio for PSD for frequency < 5Hz and frequency > 5Hz. 
The waveforms of VT and LP's are in resprective folders.
